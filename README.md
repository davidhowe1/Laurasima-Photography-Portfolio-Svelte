# Photography Portfolio
Laurasima is an analogue photographer using traditional film. The site showcases some of her work and her contact details.

### What is it?

This portfolio is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript and features various pages including a homepage, a portfolio page that shows off her work, a contact page and an about page. 

### Pages

The website is light and simple and features a clean portfolio page grid setup that displays her work as thumbnails which on click, render a larger view and a caption/description of the photograph and it's inspiration or origin.

The homepage is an infinite scrolling carousel of some of her featured work which spans the full width and the majority of the height of the viewport.

An about me page helps others to get an idea of Laurasima's practice, and features picture/text cards spanning the width of the page.

Finally, the contact page is a PHP form that lets the user fill in their name, email address, and message to send to Laurasima's email. On submission, the page redirects to a successful send confirmation page that the user can use to navigate back to the portfolio page.
